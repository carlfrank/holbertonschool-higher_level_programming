1. What is Unit Testing and How to Implement it in a Large Project?

Unit Testing is a type of testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. It is executed during the development phase to catch bugs early.

How to Implement in Large Project:

Planning: Identify the critical paths in your application and what needs thorough testing.
Tools: Choose appropriate testing tools and frameworks like JUnit, NUnit, or pytest.
Write Tests: Write tests for every function, method, or class to test individual pieces of code.
Automation: Automate the running of tests using CI/CD pipelines.
Review: Regularly review and update tests to cover edge cases and new features.

2. How to Serialize and Deserialize a Class?
Serialization is converting an object into a byte stream, and deserialization is the reverse process.

Serialization Example in Python:
import pickle

# A sample class
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

# Creating an object
p = Person("Alice", 30)

# Serializing
with open('person.pkl', 'wb') as file:
    pickle.dump(p, file)

# Deserializing
with open('person.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    person = pickle.load(file)
    print(person.name, person.age)

3. How to Write and Read a JSON File?
Write JSON:

import json

data = {
    'name': 'Alice',
    'age': 30
}

with open('data.json', 'w') as file:
    json.dump(data, file)

import json

with open('data.json', 'r') as file:
    data = json.load(file)
    print(data['name'], data['age'])

4. What is *args and How to Use it?
*args allows you to pass a variable number of non-keyword arguments to a function.

Example:

def add(*args):
    return sum(args)

print(add(1, 2, 3, 4))  # Output: 10

5. What is **kwargs and How to Use it?
**kwargs allows you to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function.

Example:

def greet(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

greet(name="Alice", age=30)

6. How to Handle Named Arguments in a Function
Named arguments are handled just like regular arguments but have names associated with them for better readability and flexibility.

Example:

def greet(name, age):
    print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")

greet(name="Alice", age=30)
